## Overview  
I’ve always wanted to create an all-in-one media tracking app that fits my style and includes the features I need. This is my attempt to build it. While the app is still a work in progress, this README documents its current state and functionality.  

### Features  
- **Local Storage**: All items added to your lists are saved locally for offline use.  
- **Automatic Updates**: TV shows, anime, and manga are checked automatically for sequels or new seasons.  
- **Data Portability**: Export and import your lists for backup or transfer.  
- **Organized Lists**: Separate categories for Movies, TV Shows, Anime, Manga, and Games.  
- **Detailed Tracking**: Record progress, scores, status, and notes for each entry.  
- **Personalized Dashboard**: Favorites and statistics are displayed on the home page.

## Requirements  
- **Python** (Developed with version **3.13.0**)  
- **Dependencies**: Install using the command below:  

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Setup
Once the remaining features are implemented, I’ll simplify the setup process. For now, follow these steps:

- Download the app manually.

- Run it locally.

- Add your API keys in the settings.
